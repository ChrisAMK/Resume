# Week 8

Hey, For this weeks assignment i updated the portfolio we made in week 2. Everything seems to be in order apart from my resume. I understand it has not been catered for the industry and i will get around to changing it on sunday, i just ran out of time this week. As for my LinkedIn, Github profile pictures, i simply do not have any recent professional photos. No doubt i will end up at the races soon and will be sure to get professional looking photo's there.
